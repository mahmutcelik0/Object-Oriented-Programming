⭐In software development, **Object-Oriented Design**
 plays a crucial role when it comes to writing flexible, scalable, maintainable, and reusable code. There are so many benefits of using OOD but every developer should also have the knowledge of the SOLID principle for good object-oriented design in programming.

### ❗ADVANTAGES of SOLID PRINCIPLE

The SOLID principle helps in reducing tight coupling. Tight coupling means a group of classes are highly dependent on one another which you should avoid in your code. Opposite of tight coupling is loose coupling and your code is considered as a good code when it has loosely-coupled classes. Loosely coupled classes minimize changes in your code, helps in making code more reusable, maintainable, flexible and stable.

There are 5 principles:

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)      (S)
- Open-Closed Principle (OCP)                 (O)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)         (L)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)      (I)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)    (D)

# Why should we use SOLID principles?

- It reduces the dependencies so that a block of code can be changed without affecting the other code blocks.
- The principles intended to make design easier, understandable.
- By using the principles, the system is maintainable, testable, scalable, and reusable.
- It avoids the bad design of the software.
